        <h2>What is this website about?</h2>
          The main question here is:<br>
          <b>What purpose does this site fulfil?</b><br>
	  The answer to this is simple: none.<br>
	  However, this website represents my pracise-tool<br>
	  to learn some HTML and CSS, plus: why not?
        <h3>Why no JS?</h3>
	  A lot of websites rely on Javascript for a few<br>
	  years now (tendency rising).<br>
	  This not only is a security and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html"><b>privacy</b></a> risk,<br>
	  it also really limits, what you can do with a text-only<br>
	  browser like <a target="_blank" href="http://lynx.browser.org/"><b>Lynx</b></a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/"><b>w3m</b></a> or even graphical<br>
	  ones like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.netsurf-browser.org/"><b>Netsurf</b></a>.<br>
	  Besides that, I want to learn how to provide a website that:<br>
	  1. Looks rather cool, even in modern browser<br>
	  2. Is fully functional in any browser<br>
        <h3>Something else?</h3>
          I want to provide and develop this website as openly as possible.<br>
          I currently use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apache.org/"><b>Apache</b></a> on my own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.debian.org/"><b>Debian-Server</b></a> to host this website.<br>
          You can also find the entire code and assets used on here on my selfhosted <a target="_blank" href="https://git.jayvii.de/jayvii.de/www/"><b>Git-Service</b></a>.<br>
          I currently have no bugtracker, but you can <a href="emailto:jayvii@riseup.net"><b>E-Mail me</b></a> to talk about issues and discover how to contribute.<br>
          Unfortunately, this website is published using <a target="_blank" href="https://ngrok.io/"><b>NGrok</b></a>, which is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/"><b>proprietary software</b></a>.
